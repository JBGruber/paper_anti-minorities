prompt:

1. Is the statement referring to LGBTQ+ rights or issues?

If the answer is "no", answer the remaining questions with NA (not applicable).

If no party is explicitly mentioned, return NA.

If the answer is "no", answer the remaining question with NA.

5. Which out-groups is the text mentioning?

Only give factual answers to the question. If there is no correct answer based on the text, return NA. Do not make things up.

Return answers in the following format:
{"1": "<Yes/No>", "2": "<Party Name or NA>", "3": "<positive/neutral/negative or NA>", "4": "<Yes/No>", "5": "<Out-group or NA>"}


{"1": "Yes", "2": "Labour", "3": "positive", "4": "No", "5": "NA"}
{"1": "Yes", "2": "Conservatives", "3": "positive", "4": "Yes", "5": "Immigrants"}
{"1": "No", "2": "NA", "3": "NA", "4": "NA", "5": "NA"}


{"1": "Yes", "2": "Labour", "3": "positive", "4": "No", "5": "NA"}
"As a society, we have made significant progress on LGBTQ+ rights, ensuring that every individual, regardless of their gender or sexuality, is treated equally under the law. Labour is committed to continuing this work for a more inclusive future."

{"1": "Yes", "2": "Conservatives", "3": "positive", "4": "Yes", "5": "Immigrants"}
"The Conservative Party stands firmly in support of LGBTQ+ rights. However, we must acknowledge that certain immigrant groups hold values that conflict with our commitment to equality, and we need to address these differences to protect our nation's liberal principles."

{"1": "No", "2": "NA", "3": "NA", "4": "NA", "5": "NA"}
"The Green Party is focused on addressing transgender rights, climate change and economic inequality."


## Packages

I use httr2 to pull articles from the Guardian API.

```{r setup}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(rollama)
start <- Sys.time() # note start time for later
prototype <- FALSE
```

## Data

```{r}
paragraphs <- readRDS("data/lgbtq_party_paragraphs.rds") |> 
  filter(nchar(text) < 1000)
if (prototype) {
  set.seed(1)
  paragraphs <- paragraphs |> 
    sample_n(20)
}
```


# Main

I retain only paragraphs that feature both a keyword from the LGBTQ list and one from the party list.

TODO:

- ask category specifically
- ask 4 (and 5) seperately
- only check homonationalism

```{r}
prompt <- "Does the text express support for LGBTQ+ rights in a way that contrasts native citizens with immigrant groups, especially with references to cultural differences? Answer only with either {Yes} or {No} or {unclear} (choose one)."


make_query <- function(txt) {
  map(txt, function(t) {
    tribble(
      ~role, ~content,
      "system", prompt,
      "user", "As a society, we have made significant progress on LGBTQ+ rights, ensuring that every individual, regardless of their gender or sexuality, is treated equally under the law. Labour is committed to continuing this work for a more inclusive future.",
      "assistant", "{No}",
      "user", "The Conservative Party stands firmly in support of LGBTQ+ rights. However, we must acknowledge that certain immigrant groups hold values that conflict with our commitment to equality, and we need to address these differences to protect our nation's liberal principles.",
      "assistant",  "{Yes}",
      "user", t
    )
  })
}
```

This retains:

```{r}
paragraphs_annotated <- paragraphs |> 
  mutate(
    query = make_query(txt = text),
    annotation = query(query, screen = FALSE,
                       model = "llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0", 
                       server = "http://192.168.2.29:11434/", 
                       output = "text",
                       model_params = list(seed = 42, temperature = 0))
  )
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
paragraphs_annotated_tidy <- paragraphs_annotated |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(annotation2 = str_extract(annotation, "\\{.+?\\}"))

paragraphs_annotated_tidy |> 
  select(-id, -par_id, -word, -set, -query) |> 
  View("annotated")
```


# Wrap-up

```{r}
saveRDS(paragraphs_annotated, "data/lgbtq_party_paragraphs_annotated.rds")
```

Afterwards we get some information which is important to reproduce the report.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
Sys.time()
# note how long the script takes to (re-)run
Sys.time() - start
```
